# Cuticular_bacteria_isolated_from_Meloidogyne_graminicola

There is the data and scripts to reproduce the analysis and the figure from __Barbier et al. 2025__ __"Biocontrol potential of J2-associated soil bacteria against *Meloidogyne graminicola* in rice field"__. 

To resume, the goal of the study was to isolate potential biocontrol agents by focusing the isolation efforts on their target organism, here *Meloidogyne graminicola* infesting larvae. During this study we sampled suppressive soils and incubated surface-disinfected larvae to allow them to acquire a new microbiota. We then led a culturomic approach on these larvae. Once the bacterial strains had been isolated, we identified them using 16S sequencing and tested their nematicidal activity using an *in vitro* test.
